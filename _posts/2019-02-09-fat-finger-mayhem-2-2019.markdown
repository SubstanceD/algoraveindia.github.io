1. Sonic Pi workshop by RAIA
In the intro to Sonic Pi, participants learn and play with the fundamental functions and fx of the platform. Live loops, samples and synthesizers are engaged using code of a pop song example. All ages welcome & no previous coding/music experience required! Sonic Pi (www.sonic-pi.net) is a live coding synthesizer with a diverse community of over one million live coders

2. Coding music for podcasts  by Joshua Thomas /Tig3rbabu
How can you use Sonic Pi to help streamline the composing process? When it comes to doing Sound Design and Music for Podcasts, in this session I'll be giving some insight into how I've been using the program to help sketch ideas and workout music arrangements for all the shows currently on Express Audio (Indian Express' Podcast channel). We’ll be going through 2 briefs for shows that I have worked on, and through the process I’ll be covering how to approach conveying the mood of a brief, tips and tricks and I’ll also be giving you a list of free online resources and repositories that will help evolve your skill and build your library of sounds. Everything will be coded in Sonic Pi.

# MusicLab 5: Lockdown Rave 10th July 2020

The 5th edition of MusicLab is an algorave (algorithmic rave) featuring [Renick Bell](http://renickbell.net/) based in Japan, [Khoparzi](https://khoparzi.com) based in India, and researchers in Norway. Renick Bell and Khoparzi will improvise live-coded music on their computers while the audience dances. We will try to measure your movement using a new MusicLab mobile application that uses smartphones' accelerometers and gyroscopes. And if you agree to it the researchers will also ask questions about the experience of the concert.

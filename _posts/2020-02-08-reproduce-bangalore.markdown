REProduce Aftertaste at Walkin Studios
Saturday, 8th February 2019, 8-11 PM

**Donor Passes available at the door at INR300**

On Saturday, February 8th, New Delhi based music collective REProduce Artists will address Algorave India infection. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to this virus. However, as a reminder, Walkin Studios always recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including:

- Don't you remember
- You told me you loved me baby?
- You said you'd be coming back this way again baby
- Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh baby

Check out the rap kingpin, summertime fine jewelry dripping. Face in the box, I have seen your ear twitching, as soon as I drove off, Cap came to me with three sawed-offs. Please give one to Rae, let's season their broth. Lightning rod fever heaters, knock-kneeder sheeba for hiva, dova got rocked from the receiver bleeder. Portfolio, they are looking fancy in the pantry; my (friend has) bigger dimes {patronizing remark), your feces are prawns. Baste that, throw what's in your mouth, don't waste that, see Ghost "lamping" in the throne with a "King Tut" hat (straight off).

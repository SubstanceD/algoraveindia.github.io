After the insane response we got last month from our event at Goethe-Insitut Max Mueller Bhavan in Mumbai we are now moving to Goa!

Yes! We are announcing Goaâ€™s first Algorave India live coding workshop hosted by House #248. Musician and live-coding artist Abhinay Khoparzi will demonstrate the basics of the free web-browser based environment Gibber. Khoparzi will be teaching participants how make music with a simplified JavaScript like programming language and making audio reactive visuals that move to the music. No software installation is required as Gibber runs in the browser and only needs an internet connection and a fairly recent version of Chrome, or Firefox.

Fee: Rs. 300 per head
No programming or music experience required
Get Laptop + Headphones/earphones

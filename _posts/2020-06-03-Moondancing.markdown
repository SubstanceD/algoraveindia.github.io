Next Tuesday, join us for a live streamed Algorave with a dramatically new lineup.

[Illest Preacha](https://www.instagram.com/illestpreacha/) from Canada will be mixing up rap/poetry along with his livecoded music in sonic pi, and visuals in hydra

[Tig3rbabu](https://instagram.com/tig3rbabu) from Mumbai will be playing back songs from his new album “Burnt Sienna is My Face”

[Nanditi](https://instagram.com/nanditi.k) from Jaipur will bring out a musician that she’s been hiding for a while and show us that a closeted nerd can still rock a party

[BeatNyk](https://instagram.com/beatnyk) is a musician/dj from Chennai who will make sounds and call them music. Hopefully everyone will agree. We honestly believe he’ll make it go boom 👊🏽

This will be a live streamed event and will also broadcast at Mozilla UXR Hubs in VR enviroment designed by [Sound.Codes](https://instagram.com/sound.codes) and [Khoparzi](https://instagram.com/khoparzi)

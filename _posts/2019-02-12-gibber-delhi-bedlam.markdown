About the Workshop:
Musician and live coding artist Abhinay Khoparzi will be conducting a workshop in Gibber, a creative coding environment that lets performers use a subset of the Javascript programming language directly in a web browser to create live music and visuals. This is a beginner's workshop and participants are not expected to have any prior programming experience. No software installation is required, all you need a computer with wifi connectivity and a recent version of Chrome or Firefox.

Hosted by Mohna Singh

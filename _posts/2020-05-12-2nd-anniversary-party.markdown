In celebration of two years of Algorave India we are presenting the country’s first ever remote VR event. Our journey started with Fat Finger Mayhem, a unique performance event that brought together artists, programmers, musicians and technologists at Max Mueller Bhavan Mumbai as part of ZKM’s Open Codes exhibition in 2018. That first has taken us through major cities across the country with ground breaking artists that make everything from algorithmic pop to digital tribalism to drum and bass and hard noise.

This first in a series of events presents a new direction for events in India in these locked down social distanced times.
